#Newes from New-castle with an advertisement, to all Englishmen that (for the safety of themselves, their King and country) they would abandon the fond opinion, (which too many doe conceave) of the Scots good meaning to England, which our fore-fathers have ever experienced to the contrary; they having bin oftentimes found to bee circumventing Machiavillians, and faythles truce breakers. This dity was written upon some occasion of newes from the north; containing the Scots surprizing of New-Castle, where they left three thousand men in garison, with a briefe touch of some of our brave cavaleirs who manfully fought in that conflict. The tune is, Lets to the wars againe.#
